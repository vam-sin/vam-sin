### Hello there ğŸ‘‹

Hello! I am Vamsi Nallapareddy! I am currently working as a Doctoral Assistant at [LTS2](https://lts2.epfl.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof. Pierre Vandergheynst](https://people.epfl.ch/pierre.vandergheynst) at the Ã‰cole polytechnique fÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne.

Apart from my academic work, I like to read books, design, and write.
