### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I am Vamsi Nallapareddy! I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the [Orengo Laboratory](http://orengogroup.info/) under the supervision of [Prof. Christine Orengo](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/orengo-group/people/prof-christine-orengo) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).

I worked on multiple projects during the course of my bachelorâ€™s degree in different domains such as Computational Biology, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Reinforcement Learning. Exploring these different fields has helped me find a passion for the application of deep learning techniques to learn more from biological data in order to build applications and tools that can make a positive impact in the world.

Apart from my academic work, I like to read books, design, and write.

I am actively looking for Ph.D. opportunities starting in the Fall of 2022. Please feel free to get in touch with me if you want to have a chat!
