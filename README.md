### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I am Vamsi Nallapareddy, a final year Computer Science undergraduate student from BITS Pilani - Hyderabad Campus. I am currently doing my Bachelorâ€™s Thesis at the Orengo Laboratory under the supervision of Prof. Christine Orengo at University College London.

I have taken up multiple projects during the course of my bachelorâ€™s degree in different domains such as Computational Biology, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Reinforcement Learning. Exploring these different fields has helped me find a passion for the application of deep learning techniques to learn more from biological data.

This Fall, I will be starting my Masterâ€™s in Computational Biology at the Carnegie Mellon University!

Apart from my academic work, I like to read books, design, and write.

I am actively looking for summer internship opportunities for the year 2022. Please feel free to get in touch with me if you want to have a chat!
